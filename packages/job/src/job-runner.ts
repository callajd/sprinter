/**
 * `JobRunner` — the single-Issue Job runner (Track A, task AE3.1). It joins
 * execution (AE1) to durability (AE2): dispatch a {@link Job} to a session via the
 * {@link ExecutionRunner} port, drive the job's prompt, consume the session's
 * events, await the terminal outcome, map it to the owned {@link JobResult}
 * envelope (D6), and persist the durable Job/session rows through the
 * {@link StateStore} port.
 *
 * It depends ONLY on the two ports ({@link ExecutionRunner} + {@link StateStore})
 * and the runner's neutral {@link SessionHandle} surface — never on a concrete
 * `pi` process or SQLite instance (INV-PORT). It is deterministic daemon control
 * flow (D2): the agent only does cognition; assigning session ids, mapping
 * outcomes, and persisting rows is all owned here.
 *
 * The Issue→Job→session mapping is durable and 1 Job = 1 session: the session id
 * is derived deterministically from the job (or reused from the job's existing
 * `sessionId`), so a re-dispatch/restart re-attaches by upserting the SAME session
 * id, never a new one (the store's `UNIQUE(session.jobId)` enforces the invariant).
