/**
 * The owned REGISTRY layer — global entities scoped to NO repository.
 *
 * {@link Agent} is its only member today. The registry is what makes "the agents
 * used in this repo" a FOLD over that repository's executions rather than a
 * stored per-repo list (INV-DERIVED): an `Agent` has no repository and no
 * workstream, so `Agent 1:∗ Execution` holds ACROSS ALL REPOS and the per-repo
 * view is computed from the executions that reference it, never persisted.
 *
 * The registry is APPEND-ONLY, and a stored revision is IMMUTABLE: once written,
 * its columns are never rewritten. That single rule generates both mutating
 * operations, and there are only these two:
 *
 * - **Edit** ⇒ append a NEW revision, under a NEW id, whose `supersedes` names the
 *   current head of the lineage. The record being replaced is untouched, so every
 *   historical execution keeps resolving to the exact agent revision that ran it.
 *   An edit MAY change any of `name` / `model` / `version` / `tools` — that is what
 *   an edit IS.
 * - **Retire** ⇒ ALSO a NEW revision under a NEW id, carrying BOTH `supersedes`
 *   (naming the head it retires) AND a `retiredAt` stamp. Retirement is NEVER a
 *   same-id stamp on an existing row — that would be a mutation, and it would make
 *   the retirement indistinguishable from the revision it retired. A retiring
 *   revision without `supersedes` is not a retirement at all but a NEW lineage that
 *   was born retired.
 *
 * Nothing is ever removed, so NO delete is exposed anywhere on the path — not on
 * the `StateStore` port, not on the contract.
 *
 * ## A retirement is LIFECYCLE-ONLY — it may not rewrite content
 *
 * A retiring revision MUST carry the SAME `name`, `model`, `version` and `tools` as
 * the head it retires; ONLY `supersedes` and `retiredAt` differ. Retirement says
 * "this lineage is out of service", not "this lineage is out of service AND its
 * tools were always empty". A retirement that also changed content would be an
 * EDIT and a retirement fused into one indistinguishable append: a reader walking
 * back from the retiring revision could no longer tell which of the two things
 * happened, and the retired head's content would appear to have changed at the
 * moment it stopped being used. Do BOTH by appending the edit first and retiring
 * the edited revision.
 *
 * This is not a convention — the `StateStore` port ENFORCES it on `putAgent` (it
 * reads the superseded revision and rejects a retiring append whose non-lifecycle
 * fields differ). The port can only check it when the superseded revision is
 * actually stored; a retiring revision naming an ABSENT `supersedes` is the same
 * dangling-chain case the acyclicity precondition already leaves to the writer.
 *
 * ## Durability is scoped to a STORE GENERATION
 *
 * "Nothing is ever removed" is a property of the REGISTRY's operations, and it holds
 * for the life of a store generation: within one generation, revisions are immutable
 * and the whole history is preserved, so a past execution resolves to the exact
 * revision that ran it. It is NOT an eternal guarantee. `SCHEMA_VERSION`
 * (`packages/state/src/sqlite.ts`) is the store's ONLY evolution mechanism and it
 * never migrates: bumping it DROPS the database and recreates it, starting a NEW
 * generation and discarding the previous one entirely. `putAgent` is the sole source
 * of truth for registry content — there is no manifest and no config to re-seed from
 * — so that reset is real, permanent data loss, ACCEPTED because `DMR` treats the
 * store as greenfield pre-release.
 *
 * The consequence a downstream task must plan for: `Execution.agentId` (DE2.2) can
 * DANGLE across a generation boundary — an execution retained by a client (or
 * re-observed from an external system) may name an `Agent` revision the reset
 * destroyed. DE2.2 must therefore treat the referent as possibly-absent and must not
 * assume resolution succeeds.
 *
 * PRECONDITION on `supersedes` (the port rejects the self-reference case; the rest
 * is the writer's obligation): the `supersedes` chain must be an ACYCLIC path
 * ending at an original revision. A revision may not supersede itself, and may not
 * supersede a revision that (transitively) supersedes it. Nothing in the store
 * enforces reachability, so a consumer walking the chain backwards
 * ({@link isOriginalRevision}) is walking a structure the WRITER must keep
 * well-formed: a cycle would make that walk non-terminating, and a dangling
 * `supersedes` would make it stop at a revision that is not the original.
 *
 * Retired-ness is read off `retiredAt`'s PRESENCE ({@link isRetired}) — there is
 * deliberately no `AgentStatus` enum, because a status enum paired with an
 * optional field admits states the domain does not have (`retired` with no
 * `retiredAt`, or an `active` agent carrying one) — INV-SUM.
 *
 * `Agent` is OWNED, not observed from an external system, so it carries no
 * `observedAt` (INV-OBSERVED). Like the read model, this is a pure description of
 * shape: it references no backing store and no running instance (INV-PORT).

/**
 * An agent in the registry: the identity that RUNS work. Global — it names no
 * repository and no workstream (INV-DERIVED / D14: repo-scoping lives on the
 * work, not on the runner).
 *
 * - `name` — the human-facing name of the agent (e.g. `"implementer"`).
 * - `model` / `version` — the model it drives and the revision of its definition.
 * - `tools` — the tool names it is permitted to use, in declaration order.
 * - `supersedes` — the PREVIOUS revision this record replaces, absent on the first
 *   revision. The append-only edit link (never a mutation in place). It must name a
 *   DIFFERENT revision and must not close a cycle — see the module docstring's
 *   precondition.
 * - `retiredAt` — the instant the agent was retired, absent while it is in
 *   service. Retirement is a stamp, NOT a status enum (INV-SUM), and NOT a delete:
 *   a retired agent's record stays readable — for the life of the store generation
 *   — so past executions still resolve. A RETIRING revision carries `supersedes` as
 *   well, and carries the SAME `name`/`model`/`version`/`tools` as the head it
 *   retires: it is a new LIFECYCLE-ONLY revision, never a stamp applied to an
 *   existing row and never a content rewrite (see the module docstring).

 * {@link isRetired} answers a question about ONE RECORD, and under append-only
 * semantics that is deliberately NOT the same question as "is this agent still in
 * service". Retiring `agt-2` appends a NEW revision `agt-3` that carries
 * `supersedes: "agt-2"` and the stamp; `agt-2` itself is immutable and stays
 * un-stamped forever. So `isRetired(agt-2)` is `false` even after the lineage is
 * retired, and it is correct that it is: the record really was never retired — its
 * LINEAGE was.
 *
 * Answering the lineage question needs the REVERSE of the `supersedes` link, which
 * no single revision carries and no store read exposes. This helper derives that
 * reverse index from a `listAgents`-shaped collection — the whole registry,
 * superseded and retired revisions included, which is exactly what `listAgents` and
 * `Snapshot.agents` hand over — and walks FORWARD from `agent` along it until it
 * reaches a stamped revision or the head of the lineage.
 *
 * `all` is read as an unordered set; `listAgents`'s id order is presentational and
 * is deliberately not relied on here. Revisions in `all` that belong to other
 * lineages are ignored. A revision superseded by TWO revisions is a malformed
 * history the writer's precondition already excludes; this walk follows the first
 * such successor it encounters and still terminates.
 *
 * Termination: the walk visits each revision at most once (it stops on re-visiting
 * one), so it terminates even if a caller hands it the cyclic `supersedes` structure
 * the module docstring's precondition forbids.
