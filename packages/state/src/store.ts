/**
 * `StateStore` — the persistence-agnostic durable spine of the daemon (Track A,
 * task AE2.1), expressed as an Effect `Context.Service` (the PORT).
 *
 * This module is the SEAM the core and every consumer depend on (D5/D14,
 * INV-PORT): it describes WHAT the daemon persists, never HOW. It references no
 * backing store, no SQL, and no running instance — a concrete backing (the
 * SQLite adapter in {@link ./sqlite.ts}) is a `Layer` provided behind this port,
 * and NOTHING outside that adapter module may import `@effect/sql-sqlite-bun`,
 * `effect/unstable/sql`, `bun:sqlite`, or SQL strings.
 *
 * The port is composed of three capability groups (INV-NAMING, `*Store` suffix):
 *
 * - {@link WorkGraphStore} — the work graph `Workstream ⊃ Epic ⊃ Issue` plus the
 *   dependency DAG (`Issue.dependsOn` edges); upserts, reads, and the child lists
 *   that status roll-up (D13) is computed from.
 * - {@link JobStore} — the `Job` model and the `Issue → Job → session → PR`
 *   mapping (1 Job = 1 session = 1 transcript = 1 PR), plus {@link Session}.
 * - {@link EventLogStore} — an append-only durable event feed (append / ordered
 *   read / tail-from-offset): the durable event record distinct from the reactive
 *   in-memory stream, supporting D17 reconciliation and AE4's snapshot.
 *
 * Every group reuses the OWNED domain schemas from `@sprinter/domain`
 * (`read-model.ts` / `ids.ts`) — they are not redefined here. All failures are
 * the owned {@link StateStoreError}; no backing-specific error (e.g. a SQL error)
 * ever crosses the port.
