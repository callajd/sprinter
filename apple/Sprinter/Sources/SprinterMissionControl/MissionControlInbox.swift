/// The Mission Control **"agent waiting on you" inbox** (BE2.2 / CE3.2): the
/// cross-session aggregation of outstanding `extension_ui_request`s, answered through
/// BE1's session channel.
///
/// It is `@Observable @MainActor`: the SwiftUI shell observes ``entries`` and
/// re-renders when a prompt arrives or is answered, and every mutation happens on the
/// main actor. The inbox owns no transport and no localness — it drives each tracked
/// session through BE1's ``InteractiveSession`` over the injected ``Backend`` port
/// (INV-PORT), and every prompt/answer it carries is a mirrored ``SprinterContract``
/// DTO (INV-CONTRACT); it never reimplements the session channel or the
/// `extension_ui_request` round-trip.
///
/// **Wait-time ordering + no-longer-outstanding (CE3.2).** The mirrored
/// `UiRequestRaised` carries no timestamp, so the inbox stamps each request's
/// CLIENT-SIDE arrival time (``arrivals``) the first time it observes it and orders
/// ``entries`` longest-waiting-first off those stamps. When a request stops being
/// outstanding — answered here or withdrawn by the daemon — its stamp is pruned and
/// it leaves ``entries``; ``isOutstanding(_:)`` is the signal a focused view reads to
/// dismiss a prompt that is no longer awaiting the user.
///
/// The projection is kept live by an Observation-driven ``reconcile()``: reading each
/// tracked session's ``InteractiveSession/outstandingRequests`` (and the tracked-set
/// itself) under `withObservationTracking` re-runs the fold whenever a prompt
/// surfaces, is answered, or the tracked set changes — no polling.
