import SprinterContract

/// The reconnecting, snapshot-consistent work-graph feed (D4 / D17 / INV-REACTIVE)
/// — the reactive spine that keeps the exposed read model current across dropped
/// connections.
///
/// It is expressed purely on the ``Backend`` port (INV-PORT): construction takes a
/// `connect` seam that yields a freshly connected ``Backend`` per attempt, so the
/// engine never names a transport or where the daemon runs.
///
/// **First connect — subscribe-around-snapshot (D4).** The first attempt starts the
/// live `events` reader FIRST (buffering deltas into ``BoundedDeltaQueue``), THEN
/// fetches the `snapshot` baseline, THEN folds the buffered + live deltas onto it with
/// ``SnapshotReconciler``. This is the ordering the daemon's `events` handler requires.
/// Reconcile is idempotent (upsert-by-id), so a buffered delta already reflected in the
/// snapshot is a harmless re-apply. Every published value is a full baseline-consistent
/// ``Snapshot`` (never a bare delta), so a slow consumer can coalesce to the latest.
///
/// **Reconnect — offset-based durable replay (CE2.2).** As deltas apply, the engine
/// tracks the last-applied **contiguous-prefix** offset (``ContiguousOffsetTracker``)
/// and retains the latest published state. On a drop it resumes by handing that offset
/// back as `sinceOffset`, so the daemon replays STRICTLY AFTER it and the engine folds
/// the new deltas onto the RETAINED baseline — an **incremental** resume, NOT a fresh
/// snapshot re-derive. This closes the disconnect gap completely (the daemon replays
/// gaplessly after the cursor) and removes the snapshot-reflicker of the old
/// re-derive-on-every-reconnect path. Only a first connect (or a drop before any
/// baseline was retained) falls back to subscribe-around-snapshot.
///
/// **Contiguous prefix, not max-seen.** The live feed can publish out of durable-offset
/// order under concurrent daemon writers, so the resume cursor is the highest offset
/// whose entire prefix has been applied — never the max — else a reconnect could skip an
/// event that is `≤ max` but was never applied (see ``ContiguousOffsetTracker``).
///
/// **Bounded backlog → resync (the production flow control).** The un-reconciled delta
/// backlog is bounded by ``BoundedDeltaQueue``: if the reconciler falls behind the `events`
/// stream, the overflow forces a reconnect+resync rather than dropping deltas or growing
/// unbounded (the carried #36 F1 recovery). This — NOT daemon-stalling demand-gating — is
/// the real end-to-end flow control on the ``RpcBackend`` path: that adapter drains the
/// per-request ``AckGate`` into an unbounded stream, so the ack does not throttle the
/// daemon; the daemon is instead capped by the ``AckGate`` backlog bound and, downstream,
/// this bounded queue whose overflow triggers the resync. Because the resume cursor tracks
/// only APPLIED offsets, the incremental resume re-sends whatever overflowed — no loss. A
/// bounded resync is the intended, better-for-a-live-UI mechanism (a live view coalesces to
/// the latest baseline; it does not need every intermediate delta stalled into it).
///
/// **Reconnect backoff + jitter (CE2.2).** Reconnect delays follow
/// ``ReconnectBackoff`` — exponential with full jitter, reset on a successful connect —
/// so a persistently-failing daemon is retried with a widening, de-synchronized delay
/// rather than a tight constant loop.
